## Project Description

This project is based on **[freeCodeCamp's Certification Project: Build a Product Landing Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-product-landing-page-project/build-a-product-landing-page)**. It features a header element with an id of `header`, and within it, an image with id `header-img`, which serves as the café's logo. The header also contains a navigation bar (`nav`) with id `nav-bar`, where users can find at least three clickable elements, each with the class `nav-link`, that navigate to corresponding sections of the page.

The landing page includes a form element with id `form`, containing an input field for email addresses (`#email`). This input field features placeholder text and utilizes HTML5 validation to ensure that the entered text is an email address. The form also includes a submit button (`#submit`) that, when clicked, submits the email to a static page.

Additionally, the page includes an embedded product video with id `video` and ensures the navigation bar remains at the top of the viewport. The design employs at least one media query and utilizes CSS flexbox for layout purposes.

## Features

- **Subscription Form**: Users can subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates.
- **Quality Features**: Information about the quality ingredients, variety of products, and service options.
- **Embedded Video**: A YouTube video showcasing our coffee-making process.
- **Product Listings**: Detailed descriptions and prices of our coffee, tea, and frappe products.
